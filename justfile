# To see a list of available commands, run `just --list`.

# To make an alpha release:
#
# 1. Run `just set-version 0.x.y-alpha.z`, where `0.x.y` will be the next
#    release.
# 2. Run `just publish-image`.
# 3. Run `cargo run -p falconeri -- deploy` to update `falconerid`.

# 1. The top-most commit must be a valid release commit in a consistent

# 2. We must follow an as-yet-incomplete semver policy.
